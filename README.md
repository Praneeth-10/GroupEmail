It is to maintain a record of email IDs that a person has to send Emails to.

which makes it easier to acess data of the particular group he likes to send emails to.
GroupEmail is to group the Mail IDs you like to be be Firnds, Family anything the name is decided
by you and you can store a 100 of mail IDs in a single group.
Once you type the email ids you can always click a group to sync with the email IDs and send it through
any mailing app you like to, The app will show the email IDs in the TO section of mail same as that
